 <h2>About Edam Cheese
 </h2>
 <p>
 Edam is a classic Dutch cheese named after the town of Edam in North Holland,
where it has been produced for centuries. In its younger form, it has a smooth, mild
flavour with subtle nutty or buttery notes. As it ages, the flavour becomes more
pronounced and it develops a firmer, slightly crumbly texture. Edam’s wax coating
helps preserve it during storage and transport, which historically made it a popular
cheese for long voyages.
 
 </p>
 <h2>Pairings</h2>
 <p>
 Pairs well with fresh fruits like apples, pears and grapes—especially when the
cheese is younger and mild.
Older, sharper Edam goes nicely with nuts, crusty bread or as part of a cheese board.
For drinks: try a dry white wine or a sparkling wine, and for younger Edam even light
beers work.
 <div class="meta-note">
 <p>Fun fact:Because of its durability and wax-coating, Edam was once one of the
world’s most exported cheeses and was carried aboard Dutch ships to distant trading
posts and colonies.
