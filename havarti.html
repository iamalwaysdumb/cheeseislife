 <h2>About Havarti Cheese</h2>
 <p>
 Havarti is a smooth, buttery Danish cheese known for its mild and slightly tangy
flavor. It has small, irregular holes throughout and a soft, creamy texture that makes
it melt beautifully. Young Havarti tastes mild and buttery, while aged Havarti becomes
richer with a nutty flavor. It’s often used in sandwiches, melted on burgers, or
enjoyed on its own as a snack.

 <h2>Pairings</h2>
 <p>
 Havarti pairs well with fruits like apples and grapes, as well as with crackers
and crusty bread. It also complements ham, turkey, and mild chutneys. For drinks, it
goes nicely with light red wines like Pinot Noir or white wines such as Chardonnay.
 </p>
 <div class="meta-note">
 <p>Fun fact: Havarti was created in the mid-1800s by a Danish woman named Hanne
Nielsen, who named it after her farm, “Havarthigaard.” Today, it’s one of Denmark’s
most popular cheeses and a favorite worldwide for its smooth texture and meltability.
