 <h2>About feta cheese
 </h2>
 <p>
 Feta is a quintessential Greek brined white cheese traditionally made from sheep's milk or a blend with up to 30% goat's milk, protected by a PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) status. It is characterized by its tangy, salty flavor and a soft, crumbly texture that is achieved through a minimum of three months of aging in a salty brine solution. Feta's bold taste makes it perfect for crumbling over Greek salads, baking into pastries like spanakopita, or serving simply with olive oil and oregano.

 <h2>Pairings</h2>
 <p>
 Feta's salty, tangy, and slightly acidic flavor pairs beautifully with foods that offer a contrast in sweetness, coolness, or richness. For a perfect bite, crumble Feta over cool, crisp elements like watermelon, cucumber, and tomatoes to create the classic refreshing contrast seen in Mediterranean salads. The cheese's intensity is best balanced by Extra Virgin Olive Oil and fresh herbs like oregano and mint. When selecting a drink, choose light, crisp options, such as Sauvignon Blanc or sparkling water with lemon, as their acidity cuts through the cheese's saltiness and refreshes the palate.
 <div class="meta-note">
 <p>Fun fact: The first known description of a cheese similar to Feta is found in Homer's epic poem, The Odyssey, where the Cyclops Polyphemus is depicted making and ripening sheep's milk cheese in brine in his cave—a practice dating back to the 8th century B.C.
