 <h2>About Gorgonzola Cheese
 </h2>
 <p>
 Gorgonzola is a famous Italian blue cheese known for its creamy texture and bold,
tangy flavor. It comes in two main varieties: Gorgonzola Dolce (sweet and soft) and
Gorgonzola Piccante (strong and crumbly). The blue veins are formed by special molds
during aging, giving the cheese its unique appearance and sharp, earthy taste. It’s
often used in sauces, on pizzas, or spread on bread.

 <h2>Pairings</h2>
 <p>
 Gorgonzola pairs beautifully with honey, pears, figs, and walnuts. It also
complements pasta, risotto, and salads. For drinks, it goes well with dessert wines
like Moscato or full-bodied reds such as Barolo and Chianti.
 <div class="meta-note">
 <p>Fun fact:Gorgonzola is one of the world’s oldest blue cheeses, believed to
have been made as early as the 9th century in the town of Gorgonzola near Milan. Its
distinct flavor develops from aging in cool, humid caves that encourage the growth of
its famous blue veins.
